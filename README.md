# PJ Laudun CodeSamples
This is an ongoing repository of code samples for my portfolio.

In this repository you will find code samples using:

- Javascript/JQuery
- HTML/Razor Pages
- CSS/SASS/SCSS
- ReactJS, Angluar, Blazor, or Vue

Finally, I am a Front-End web developer, with some UI/UX Design skills, I also have near 5 years of experience in mostly greenfield development. Because of this I also have included some:

- User Interface Design work 
- User Experience Design work

Feel free to look though my work. I am constantly working on becoming more proficent using various frameworks or with vanilla JS (ES6+), so this repo will constantly continue to have updates (what can I say, I love creating things :D ).

Thanks for stopping by!
