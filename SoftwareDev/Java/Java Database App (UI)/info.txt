Database UI Application
By, Paul Laudun 2016

This is my database demo project. 
This project is the same as the non-UI database demo but with a User Interface. The database used is a relational Apache Derby database. The database is embedded, so this program will work as a standalone application. This program will allow you to; cycle through, update, delete, and create new records. This program is to mimmic a simple application that will monitor employees in a small buinsess. It only covers the; First Name, Last Name, and Job Title.

There are two folders in this folder:

- Code: This folder will have the actual copy of the java file used to program this application. This is just give an example of my skill.
- UIDatabase: This folder will have the completed, wrapped, and compiled, EXE file. If you have a Windows OS, you could open this up to install it on your PC to show the finished result.

Thank you and enjoy.

Updates:
3/10/2016 - Refactored the Workers.java file so that it is more compact and extensible.
