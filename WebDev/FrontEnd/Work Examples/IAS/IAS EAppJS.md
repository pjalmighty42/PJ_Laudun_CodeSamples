# Insurance Administrative Solutions
### EAppJS Javascript/JQuery Library work

#### Explaination
This was was a framework that was created while working at Insurance Administrative Solutions as a front-end/ReactJS, UI/UX, developer. This was library was created as a result of the company needing business-facing application for data-entry of various umbrella clients/companies under their company. 

#### Issue
This needed to work with older technology stack (ASP MVC 4), as such I couldn't use a more modern approach like I did for their ReactJS client-facing application.

#### Requirements
Because of this, this solution need to:
1. Mimmick the dynamic nature of the ReactJS client-side 
2. Use the same API for questions on the form as for the ReactJS client-side
3. But be a strictly JS/JQuery-based solution because of the limitation of the tech-stack

#### Solution
The solution that I came up with was to figure out and mimmic the basic premise of how React functions. To basically take in the API list of any size of controls (a JSON list), and dynamically allow for the creation of the various controls to show on the fly. This is a posting of this for my portfolio/resume. Feel free to look it over! It is unfinished at the moment, but I am actually doing some of the updates that I wanted to do to this (before I was let go),
